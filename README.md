# my-pdm-project-cwprogram-test

This repository is meant to showcase how to build and publish a python project
for beginners using PDM. The tutorial for creating the underlying code and tooling
can be found on my [dev.to python beginner series](https://dev.to/cwprogram/basic-python-project-layout-1pg2). 
Given that the focus of this is more project layout, the underlying code is very
simplistic and not very practical for real world applications. As such it in no
way reflects the quality of code I would write in a professional business setting.
